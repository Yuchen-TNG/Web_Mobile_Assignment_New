Suggestion 1:
i think room type change to database will be best not like direct coding 
exp:            
<label for="type" class="form-label">Type</label>
	<select class="form-select" id="type" name="type">
		<option value="Master Room">Master Room</option>
		<option value="Big Medium Room">Big Medium Room</option>
		<option value="Medium Room">Medium Room</option>
		<option value="Single Room">Single Room</option>
		<option value="Whole Unit">Whole Unit</option>
	</select>


Suggestion 2 :
